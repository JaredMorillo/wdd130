    <p>I was born in Ecuador, I am 21 years old and I love music and arts, most</p>
        <p>of the time I spent my time in work and also in the things that I
        appreciate to spent my time.</p> <p>I use to play with my ukelele
        after my work and also learn some magic tricks to show all my family.</p>
    <p>I live with my family, mom and dad are awesome, and with my brother and
        sister, I'm in the Chruch since I have memory, but my parents are
        converts.</p> <p>After the had my brother, my dad found the Church with the
        missionaries, and after two weeks they got baptized, and the all family
        is now an eternal family.</p>
