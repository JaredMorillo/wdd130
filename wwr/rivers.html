            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the 
                number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. 
                The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.             
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. 
                As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. 
                High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days                   
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.                    
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
                The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

                <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
                <p>What an incredible season we have had. 
                    We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. 
                    This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. 
                    We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. 
                    The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and 
                    loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). 
                    Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. 
                    We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

            <button class="accordion">What is included in the trip?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair.
                We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</p>

            <button class="accordion">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
                Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. 
                Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. 
                The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. 
                We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or 
                explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...
                and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be 
                able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>
