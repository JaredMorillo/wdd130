      <p>Has it happend to you that sometimes in changes of seasons feel sick or you catch a flu?, 
        most of the time we buy medicines or checking our health with the doctor, 
        but an easy way to prevent the illness or sickness is the lemon juice.

        and also different ways to change the diet and commercialize different products about healthy food.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is for the people who are searching better ways to stay healthy, and for those who had
        health illnesses. With this Covid-19 most of the people were affected because of their economy or maybe 
        with their health and this website the people can share the knowledge and sell their products for benefits
        to the people who had troubles for their illnesses and for them who doesn't have a good economic status.
